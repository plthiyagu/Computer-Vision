# Computer-Vision, Implementation of CNN

# 1_Layer_CNN
this file cosist of 1 layer of each convolutional layer and pooling layer. 

 >> Convolution layer, including:
  * Zero Padding
  * Convolve window
  * Convolution forward
  
 >>Pooling layer, including:
  * Pooling forward
  * Create mask
  * Distribute value
  
# Application of CNN
this python program uses tensorflow module of python to design a simple neural network of few conv and pooling layers  which would tell what numerical numbers (0 - 6) a hand sign is showing.

 >> The model :
 * creates placeholders
 * initializes parameters
 * forward propagates
    Implements a three-layer ConvNet in Tensorflow:
       CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED
 * computes the cost
 * creates an optimizer
