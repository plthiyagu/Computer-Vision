# Computer-Vision, Implementation of CNN

# 1_Layer_CNN
this file cosist of 1 layer of each convolutional layer and pooling layer. 

 >> Convolution layer, including:
  * Zero Padding
  * Convolve window
  * Convolution forward
  
 >>Pooling layer, including:
  * Pooling forward
  * Create mask
  * Distribute value
  
# Application of CNN
this python program uses tensorflow module of python to design a simple neural network of few conv and pooling layers  which would tell what numerical numbers (0 - 6) a hand sign is showing.

 >> The model computes :
 * create placeholders
 * initialize parameters
 * forward propagate
 * compute the cost
 * create an optimizer















Yet to be updated and upload of necessary file is pending.
