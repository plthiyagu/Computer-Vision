# YOLOv2

In this project a real life object detection Keras Model has implemented using a pretrained YOLOv2 neural network.

## Requirements:

i) Pretrained weights of networks and cfg file to configure the network.

you can download it from YOLO's official website.

[https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/] what is used here is YOLOv2 608X608 (input image size).

ii) Weights available on the website are for darknet framework(written in C and CUDA). to convert that in keras you can use yad2k and CFG file.

rest of information is provided in yad2k directory.
