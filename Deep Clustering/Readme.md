# Deep Clustering
Clustering is the task of dividing the set or data points into a number of groups called clusters such that data points in the same cluster are more similar to other data points in the same cluster than those in other cluster.
Deep Clustering is performing task of clustering using Deep Nueral Networks.

## Why Deep Learning
Data pionts to be clustered are multi-dimentional numerical vectors, which are to be seprated on the basis of their euclidean distance.
But in this case we are going to Cluster a set of images, which can't be considerd as suitable data points (a RGB image of 100X100 size would have vector size of 30000 dimention). 
So we use deep neural network to minimise the dimention in meaningful way.
